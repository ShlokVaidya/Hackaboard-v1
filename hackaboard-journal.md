## 1/13/2026 6:24 PM - Starting Hackaboard!!!  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

# Why
I wanted to build a custom mechanical macro keyboard from scratch, not just assemble a kit. The goal was to understand how keyboards actually work at the hardware and firmware level—matrix scanning, diodes, microcontrollers, and firmware like KMK/QMK. I also wanted something practical that I could actually use every day.

# I chose the Pico 2 because:
- It uses the RP2040, which is widely supported in the keyboard community
- It has plenty of GPIO pins for a matrix, encoder.
- Strong documentation and examples exist for CircuitPython and KMK
- It’s powerful enough while still being beginner-friendly.

## 1/13/2026 6:31 PM - Drawing the schematics !  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I started by adding all the footprint and symbol library from #hackpad in an sheet. And drew the schematics for the whole hackaboard, this was probably the easiest part. 

# Raspberry Pi Pico 2

# Encoder and 45mm Potentiometer Slider

# The Main Keyboard Matrix

# 0.91" OLED Display
![Screenshot 2026-01-13 142027](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE4ODksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--30e22629e19c013c34211a3c611d9d50ae74aa19/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20142027.png)

Final after an hour I completed the schematics.
I asked help from #blueprint-help to check if my schematics was right, and err there were a few errors like mismatching wiring of the OLED display and encoder. But after reviewing I fixed all the errors.  

## 1/13/2026 6:35 PM - Routed the PCB  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

After completing the Schematics headed over to routing the pcb.
This was not so easy more like solving maze problems :cry: . After around 3 hours of changing the design of the board and rerouting and DRC checks, I completed routing the PCB.

## 1/13/2026 6:41 PM - CADDING   

_Time spent: 6.0h_  

Now the most most awaiting part was CADING, tbh i am trash at this, i had to watch a few tutorials before actually starting.

I choose FreeCAD thinking Apps are better than web based apps, and I was wrong, I found even more complicating. I heard that Onshape is most used among Hack Clubbers, so again watch tutorials, and this turned out to be easier and smooth as i dont have a DGPU, am running IGPU :cry:. It took me around two days to design the case, around 6hrs of CADING. As this is my first time so yeah excuses me as i am still learning.

# Final Result

## 1/13/2026 8 PM - Shoooping  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I hate to bring it to you but i tried my best to reduce the cost but its sky rocket high :( pls DM me if you can help me reduce the BOM.

# First of the MCU and 1N4148 SOD-123 Diode :
Raspberry Pi Pico 2 cost around Rs600. And the diodes cost around Rs1/per diode.

![Screenshot 2026-01-13 181433](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5MDQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--97be61b5b3f2056c8f7bd71efc9e17ba227979a1/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20181433.png)

Also there's a shipping fee of Rs 49

![Screenshot 2026-01-13 181442](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5MDYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3100a001699895df0e564aa0017cb81b2651397e/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20181442.png)

BTW, I am purchasing from [Robu.in](https://robu.in) and since the grant is in USD i need to pay the conversion that's around 3%. Which comes around **Rs650** or **7.2USD**

# Next is the PCB:
I wanna avoid customs so i choose [Lion Circuit](https://www.lioncircuits.com) with base settings which costs a whooping Rs5281 (incl. Shipping and GST) adding a 3% conversion fee totals up to **Rs5440** which is **60.1 USD**. 

![Screenshot 2026-01-13 181311](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5MTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--79ddad86e8c3926f782f0423deb5441587f57f06/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20181311.png)

# Key switches, stabilizer and Keycaps:
So the Key switches and stabilizers along with the Hot swap sockets cost Rs3604. 
So i am buying a x45 + x10 pack of Key switches. From [StacksKB](stackskb.com)

![Screenshot 2026-01-13 181338](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5MTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--01fbe491c551f042031e95029c99b951621fca15/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20181338.png)
![Screenshot 2026-01-13 181357](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5MTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a9e31f12ae6cff45aeb396354ed734f8a719f1ef/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20181357.png)

For Keycaps i went with [CuriosityCaps](https://curiositycaps.in/)
Rs 1999 with conversion fee its **Rs 2058** or **22 USD**.
![Screenshot 2026-01-13 181418](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5MjAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a42438a1475d1ff5bb47e8b4e0f0f7ac9c1fa784/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20181418.png)

# And then for screws i chose from onlyscrews.in which comes around Rs 200 with some shipping charges ( idk during the payout i get the shipping charges probly around 100-300 ) so totals to Rs 400 inc conversion fee ! so around ** 4.5 USD **.

# Plate
I dont if the grant covers this but still putting it
So i need a Polycarbonate 1mm which costs Rs 220 
![Screenshot 2026-01-13 194842](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5NDIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--88534924e1351f05d15f8973b77f4d72f1d450a4/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20194842.png)
![Screenshot 2026-01-13 194857](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5NDMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3da02b761277b058750c8ca27bcf35c9b01123b7/Screenshot%202026-01-13%20194857.png)
So totally Rs 330 ( incl of Conversion fee ) or **3.6USD**

## 1/13/2026 9 PM - Rendering  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

I have provided all the info required on where the grant is being used, if anything other that required pls DM. I tried to reduce the BOM as much as possible.
